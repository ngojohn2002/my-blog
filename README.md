## Web APIs Personal Blog

This project utilizes JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM) to create a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. It includes a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle.

## User Story

```md
AS A marketing student,
I WANT a personal blog
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a personal blog

1. WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.

2. WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.

3. WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.

4. WHEN I try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.

5. WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.

6. WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.

7. WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.

8. WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.

9. WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.

10. WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.

11. WHEN I view the footer,
THEN I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
